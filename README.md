### **Game Description**
The game is set in 1995, in Texas, and follows a day in the life of a farmer, Alex, as he deals with daily challenges on his farm. The game features three different maps representing different stages of Alex's journey to fix a problem on his farm. Along the way, Alex meets friends and family who help him overcome obstacles and achieve his goals. The game offers a warm, nostalgic experience, touching on themes such as friendship and connection with the past.

### **Development Phases**

**Analysis**:
- The team decided early on the basic storyline of the game.
- After brainstorming, the story chosen was "a day in the life of a farmer named Alex."
- The game environment was divided into three distinct areas: 
  1. **Farm**: The starting and ending environment where Alex interacts with his surroundings.
  2. **Forest**: The transitional environment between the Farm and the City.
  3. **City**: The environment where Alex resolves the main issue and returns to the farm.

**Design**:
- **Unity Version**: 2022.3.13f1
- **Farm**: Designed with terrain, roads connecting farm structures, and realistic elements like trees, fields, greenhouses, and farm vehicles.
- **Forest**: Includes a road connecting the farm to the city, with rivers and a waterfall.
- **City**: Features roads and potential locations for houses.

**Implementation**:
- Added realistic elements such as trees, mountains, rivers, houses, and cars to the terrains.
- **Farm**: Completed with interactive elements like automatic irrigation, moving NPCs, and sounds.
- **Forest**: Includes nature sounds, water and air effects, moving cars with NPCs, and predefined paths.
- **City**: Added moving cars and NPCs with predefined paths using NavMeshPath, and unique interactions when the player approaches or looks at certain NPCs using RayCast.
